Dev log

18/02/24
-Initial creation

19/02/24
-Created simple layout for navbar along with CSS
-Created new components for different segments

20/02/24
-Added dev log to repo
-Changed GlamSegment.jsx and GlamSegment.jsx; the map iteration was moved from GlamSegment to GlamPanel.
 This stopped multiple segments with one panel being rendered instead of one segment with multiple panels,
 which was the desired outcome in the first place.

21/01/24
-Created images resource folder
-Added NGS Arks logo to images folder
-Created SidePanel.jsx; this is going to be used to display infomation on the side of the webpage

23/03/2024
-Created basic page swapping functionality
-Created 'pages' folder to hold the different pages that will be used
-Moved main page functionality to 'Home.jsx'

24/02/24
-Created 'Looksbook.jsx'; this page is simply going to be used to display the selected look using
 the page as a template to display the information received from the server.
-Created 'Library.jsx'; this page is for showing every avaiable design for the user to look at. Looks
 can be searched for using the options in the side panel and then narrowed down using the sort functions.

25/02/24
-Created 'SearchSidePanel.jsx' and 'SortBar.jsx'; these components are for the 'Library.jsx' page in order
 to allow the user to narrow down the looks to specific criteria, making finding what they want easier.

26/02/24
-Added dropdown menus to 'SortBar.jsx' and 'SearchSidePanel.jsx'
-Added checkboxes to 'SearchSidePanel.jsx'

04/03/24
-Created 'Footer.jsx'
-Altered 'GlamPanel.jsx'; this is to make it behave differently when used with the main page and the library
 page.

 11/03/24
 -Added seperate CSS files for modules. Simply makes things easier to read
 -Added functionality to have pages scroll to the top automatically

12/03/24
-Fixed issue of child components not filling the parent (all '.main' divs). This led to the parents
 having heights of 0px, whilst the children were overflowing. This was due to the position of the
 children being 'absolute'. To fix this, the 'position' property has been removed entirely, whilst
 the parent have had their 'display' property changed to 'flex' and the 'flex direction' changed to
 'row'. This is the same as what was done with the navbar and achieves the desired result of having
 child components side by side whilst also allowing the parent to have a height that matches the
 children. Doing this makes styling a lot easier.

13/03/24
-Added new component 'LookCard.jsx'; this component is just a way to make it easier to style the cards
that display the looks.

14/03/24
-Completely redid colour scheme and general layout to make things looks less "loud" and chaotic. Shit looks
 easier to look at now

16/03/24
-Added hero banner; this was lifted straight from Eorzea Collection and tweaked to get it to work

20/03/34
-Started adding pagination in 'GlamPanel.jsx' to allow multiple pages of looks to be cycled through

21/03/24
-Implemented custom pagination in 'GlamPanel.jsx'; this allows user to cycle through the looks, with
 the previous and next buttons not being visible if they no longer can be used to navigate further.
-Used different pagination method; this removes the previous pagination method from 'GlamPanel.jsx' and
 puts it into two different components, 'Pagination.jsx' and 'usePagination.jsx'. This allows it to be
 in more places a lot easier. These components use the same stylesheet as 'GlamPanel.jsx'. Consider
 renaming the stylesheet and tidying up the file structure and components.

26/03/24
-Added 'SlideShow.jsx'; this will is used to add a slideshow effect that users can see
 on the Looksbook page when they've selected a look.
-'Looksbook.module.css' was deleted; this wasn't needed and 'LookBreakdown.module.css' is being
 used instead

27/03/24
-Made 'NavBar.jsx' mobile responsive

28/03/24
-Added gitpages functionality

#TODO#
-Add align-text: center to everything instead of .App. This messes with the positioning of ::after tags.
 This can be fixed by fixing the positions to absolute and assigning a left/right but this might lead to
 more problems down the road.
-Sort Looksbook page
-Add more global variables for borders, margins, padding etc
-Make site mobile friendly






#Ideas#
-Make sortbar and side search bar stay in a fixed position when user is scrolling
